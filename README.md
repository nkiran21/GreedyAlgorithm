# GreedyAlgorithm
Let's get greedy. In greedy algorithm, our job is to execute minimum number of coins to be rolled out. Its very simple and direct code. No control input, input needs to given in code. easy explaination. 
Expaoing through an example: 
Say the user requires €0.42 change. We could do this by giving them 42 cents, one cent each. Or I could also use five coins -- by giving them four dimes, €0.10 each, and two cents, €0.01 each. Once the user runs the greedy program, they'll be prompted to give the amount of change in euros that they're owed. And then your program will output the minimum amount of coins that the greedy user would use to make that amount of change. So now let's break this down into our subtasks. The heart of the greedy algorithm, which is always using the largest coin possible 1. Prompt the user for an amount of change - The amount must make sense - What values are accepted - MinimumCoinsNeeded 2. Always use the largest coin possible - How many coins to be returned - amount to be returned 3. Keep track of coins used and total number of coins 4. Print the final number of coins
